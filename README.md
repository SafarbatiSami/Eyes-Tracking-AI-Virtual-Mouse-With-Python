# Eyes-Tracking-AI-Virtual-Mouse-With-Python
The "Eyes Tracking AI Virtual Mouse With Python"  Project is an application that uses computer vision techniques to track the movements of a person's eyes and use these movements to control a virtual mouse on a computer screen. <br>
The application is built using **Python**,**OpenCV** and **Mediapie**, which is a popular computer vision library. It works by using a camera to capture video of the person's face, and then detecting the position of the eyes within the video frames. The position of the right eye is then used to move the mouse cursor on the screen and the left eye is used to click when blinking. This type of technology has many potential applications, including providing assistance to individuals with disabilities that make it difficult to use a traditional mouse <br>
